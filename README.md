# Task: Creating and Using [Local] Python Packages 

>## Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

Rock-Paper-Scissors is a simple two-player game where, at a signal, players make figures with their hands, representing a rock, a piece of paper, or a pair of scissors. The winner is determined according to a set of rules. You can find the official rules under the Resources.


- If the two players choose the same “character” it’s a tie, and the game repeats
    ```
    Rock beats Scissors
    Paper beats Rock
    Scissors beats Paper
    ```

You have been tasked to create a simple version of this game with Python. In your version, one player will be controlled by the computer and the other player controlled by you - the user (i.e CPU vs Player). 

- You should make use of the inbuilt Python module random and its choice method.
#

>## Instructions:

- Create a new Python file and call it main.py. Inside it you'll create your game.
- Create a list to store all possible options:
    ```
    "R" for "rock", 
    "P" for "paper", 
    "S" for "scissors"
    ```
- When the program is run, ask the user to pick an option between "R", "P" or "S"
- If user input is invalid (not amongst our options), print an error, and ask for their input again (should be a loop)
- Use the `choice` function from the inbuilt Python `random` module to make a choice for CPU player(computer).
- Print both player's moves in the format: `Player (Rock) : CPU (Paper)`
- Check both player's moves: 
- If there is a winner, print the winner, and the program ends. 
- If it's a tie (the computer and player pick the same move), restart the game from step 3

- Created a main.py file
- Imported random module
- Created a list with options for the game (R, P, S)
- Prompted the user for input
- Used a while look to check if the user input is in the list of options
- Used the choice method from random module to generate a random choice for the CPU
- Assigned user readable names to the options for the player and the CPU
- Printed both the player's and CPU moves in the format: `Player (Rock) : CPU (Paper)`
- Checked for a winner and used a print statement to print the user and the option that they chose.
- Ended the program if there is a winner
- Ensured that the game restarts if there's a tie.
